# WebIntent Android Plugin for Cordova

## Why this fork
- Merge all changes from (https://github.com/cordova-misc/cordova-webintent). Feb.24, 2018
- I use this plugin to allow my cordova app to accept files (any files) from another app.
- I use this plugin to allow my cordova app to share files (any files) to another app.
- Change the onNewIntent() to process the Intent.EXTRA_STREAM (accepting files from other apps)
- Change the startActivity() to allow sharing any file using file://, using the FileProvider for Android N.
- I use it in my Phonegap Build project (https://build.phonegap.com)

## FileProvider on Android N. and above

You will need the following in AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
        <provider
            android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="com.yourcompany.provider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true">
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" />
        </provider>
```
And provider_paths.xml in the res/xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths>
    <external-path
        name="external_files" path="." />
</paths>
```
If you aleady include some other plugins, like the camera plugin, those changes should have already in your project.

## Using Phonegap Build
Use either
```xml
    <plugin name="cordova-plugin-webintent2" spec="1.0.4" />
```
OR 
```xml
    <plugin spec="https://github.com/okwei2000/webintent.git" source="git" />
```

## Sending Multiple Attachments

You can now use this plugin to email multiple attachments as follows:

```js
	var email_attachments = [
								"file:///storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.your_company.your_app/files/file1.pdf",
								"file:///storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.your_company.your_app/files/file2.csv"
							];

	var external_extras = {};
	external_extras[window.plugins.webintent.EXTRA_STREAM] = email_attachments.join();
	external_extras[window.plugins.webintent.EXTRA_EMAIL] = "";
	external_extras[window.plugins.webintent.EXTRA_SUBJECT] = "My subject text";
	external_extras[window.plugins.webintent.EXTRA_TEXT] = "My email body text";

	window.plugins.webintent.startActivity({action: window.plugins.webintent.ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE, extras: external_extras, type: "text/plain"}, function() {console.log("Success!");}, function() {console.log("Failure!");});
```

## Disclaimers
- I'm not an Android nor Cordova Plugin developer, I have little knowledge on how Android and the plugin works, especially Intent. I just made this plugin works for my own purpose. I just copy & pasted code from other plugins to make it work. If you know how to clean up the code, please let me know.
